NTupliser for Brunel group

The famous nTupliser passed down from one generation of Brunel phD student to the next. 
All our marks left indelibly on it, if no other reason than that the next guy has no idea what we did.
Needs documentation, cleaning and... I dunno, re-writing?

Stuff that I know needs to be fixed before run2:

-getByLabels need to be changed to consumes

Enjoy, future students.
